	    	I'm a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> based in Bel√©m, the largest city in the Brazilian amazon rain forest. Lately I've been working with EmberJS, Cordova, Electron, PHP/Code Igniter, WordPress and API development. I am also a researcher on Human-Computer Interaction and Informatics in Education with two published papers about an application I developed for teaching the basics of Computer Prograaming to low income public school children in Brazil.
